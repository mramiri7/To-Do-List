# To-Do-List
This is a To Do List web app using django and basic HTML, CSS

This project includes one app called tasks and it has only one model named Task

I used django User model and for the register form I used django UserCreationForm

I tried to use class-based views for all the views related to tasks and I used function-based views for regitration and stuff like that

For authorization, I simply used django functions
